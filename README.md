# Old-roblox-projects-made-by-me-that-are-free-software
Legacy projects made by me that are now being released as free software.
These are very old projects and won't be maintained unless the bug is gamebreaking.
Feel free to fork this or even use some of these open source projects in your own game.
Open a issue if you encounter a Lua virus that you can't remove and bugs, but game breaking bugs have a higher chance of being fixed (if you know how to fix the bug feel free to open a pull request)
Current projects released here:
Meeting, it is still in use but I am providing it as a template, this project uses alot of free models so credit to the people who made the free models also.

As of 9/24/2022 at 11:43 PM EDT everything in this repo is licensed under the GPLv2 unless stated otherwised. Read LICENSE for more information.
And also, you may be asking, "Why is it called "free software" when it is open source?
It is called free software, as open source means source is avalible, which free software has it's source avaiable. However the term open source is incorrect as it says the source is avaiable, but it does not show any thing about rights to modify and distribute the source freely, a license like the GPL allows the source to be avaiable, but also gives freedom to the user to freely modify and distribute the software as long the modfication is has it also licensed off the GPL, a term meaning copyleft.
Think free software as free speech, not free beer.
So, free software means that the source is avaiable but the users freedoms are also kept.
Sadly, I can't change the repo name as it can not be changed once it is created.
Notes:
Due to Roblox being non free software, it is impossiable to decompile the game without opening studio, however you may view all the scripts and models inside of studio, which give you the code for the scripts and game, and all these games in this repo are licensed under the GPL.
The meeting game under extended LTS is v1.0, LTS is stable versions, latest is bleeding edge.
Latest usally contains stable versions. They will eventually be moved to LTS and Extended LTS. LTS has very stable, but more outdated versions, Extended LTS is very very stable and it is where stable releases will be moved. For supported projects it is always latest and is stable. If you want a long term solution, you will want to use extended LTS first as it is easier to upgrade from version to version. LTS is recommended, but you may have to migrate more. Latest will have more trouble migrating.

The meeting game is currently under Extended LTS support, and will be supported until 2024, and v2 is under latest, and once V3 releases it will be moved to LTS.

Releases are provided, however cloning the repo is better as you can update faster.
