# Old-roblox-projects-made-by-me-that-are-open-source
Legacy projects made by me that are now being open sourced
These are very old projects and won't be maintained unless the bug is gamebreaking.
Feel free to fork this or even use some of these open source projects in your own game.
Open a issue if you encounter a Lua virus that you can't remove and bugs, but game breaking bugs have a higher chance of being fixed (if you know how to fix the bug feel free to open a pull request)
Current projects released here:
